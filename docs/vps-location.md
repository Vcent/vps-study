# VPS location 

 For the best connection from China to access resources in the US, Japan, and Europe, I recommend these VPS locations:

1. Novosibirsk (OVB1 or OVB2, Russia):  
   - This is the most popular and stable option for clients in China, offering low latency and reliable routing both toward Asia and international destinations.
   - Great as a bridge for both US and Europe, as well as direct Asian connectivity.

2. Tokyo, Japan (TYO1):  
   - Ideal for direct access to Japanese resources; also provides fast routes to the US West Coast and decent connections to China.
   - Excellent for gaming, streaming, and business in Japan.

3. Los Angeles, USA (QLA1) and New York, USA (NYC1):  
   - Los Angeles (QLA1): Best for US West Coast resources, often with acceptable latency from China.
   - New York (NYC1): Great for US East Coast and also for access to some European targets.

4. Frankfurt, Germany (FRA1) and Amsterdam, Netherlands (AMS1):  
   - Frankfurt (FRA1): Central Europe hub—very good routing to both Europe and the US.
   - Amsterdam (AMS1): Another strong European node, good connectivity for international traffic.

5. Singapore (SIN1):  
   - If your priority is Asia-Pacific routing, Singapore is well connected and often fast from China, especially for international platforms.
