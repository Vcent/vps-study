  - [myip.com](www.myip.com) — shows your public IP and geolocation.
  - [ipinfo.io](ipinfo.io) — detailed IP, ASN, and geolocation data.
  - [dnsleaktest.com](dnsleaktest.com) — checks which DNS servers are being used and detects possible DNS leaks.
  - [whoer.net](whoer.net) — comprehensive IP, DNS, and VPN/Proxy detection.
